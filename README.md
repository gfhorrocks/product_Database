Bamazon Inventory

Customer portal - (/bamazonCustomer.js)
Allows user to purchase items from a mock product database.  App uses Inquirer to ask for an item id and number of units to purchase.  Script then checks to make sure the order can be fulfilled and if so, removes the product from the MYSQL database and calculates order total.  

Manager portal - (/bamazonManager.js)
Allows manager to view all the products listed in database, view low inventory items ( those less than 5 stock), add stock to an item or add a entirely new product.
